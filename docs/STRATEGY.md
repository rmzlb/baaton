# Baaton Strategy — AI-First Orchestration Board

## Core Positioning
> **"You orchestrate. AI executes."**

Baaton is NOT another Linear clone. It's the **first issue tracker built for AI-augmented teams**.

## Differentiation: AI-First

### What Linear does:
- Great UI, fast, keyboard-first
- Human-centric workflows
- AI as a feature (suggestions, summaries)

### What Baaton does differently:
- **Agent API** — Connect YOUR coding agent (OpenClaw, Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
- **Built-in PM Agent** (Premium) — AI project manager that triages, assigns, estimates, and follows up
- **MCP Server** — Any AI tool can read/write issues natively
- **AI Skills** — `npx skills add @baaton/agent-skills` for any AI agent
- **Cross-org** — Manage multiple companies/teams from one dashboard

### The Vision:
1. Human creates high-level goals/initiatives
2. AI PM breaks them into milestones + issues
3. AI coding agents pick up issues, implement, PR
4. AI PM reviews progress, triages blockers, reassigns
5. Human reviews, approves, steers

**Linear = Human orchestrating humans**
**Baaton = Human orchestrating AI agents**
